            It allows you to be very creative<br />
            You can control every little aspect<br />
            You can show off whatever you want to through the internet
        </ul>

            This is really not going well for me so far and I have taken a web
            design class before. I made a whole website and coded the entire
            thing from scratch. I don't remember much about that as it was 8+
            years ago
